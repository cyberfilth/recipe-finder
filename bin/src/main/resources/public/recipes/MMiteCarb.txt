Marmite carbonara
20 Minutes  Serves 2 Easy

Ingredients
egg yolks 2
Marmite 2 tsp
parmesan or vegetarian alternative 30g, finely grated, plus extra to serve
spaghetti or linguine 175g
garlic 1 fat clove, squashed a bit with the side of a knife
extra virgin olive oil
curly parsley a small handful, finely chopped to serve

Method
STEP 1

Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil while you mash together the egg yolks, Marmite and grated parmesan with some freshly ground pepper. Once the water is boiling, add the pasta and cook until just tender.

STEP 2

Put the garlic and 2 tbsp olive oil in a cold frying pan, then bring to a medium heat and fry until the garlic is golden and crispy, then fish it out and discard.

STEP 3

Reserve a small cup of the pasta water then drain. Take the frying pan off the heat and tip in the pasta, followed by the Marmite mixture and a good splash of cooking water. Toss together until the pasta is glossy and evenly coated. Serve with plenty more grated parmesan and a sprinkling of parsley.
